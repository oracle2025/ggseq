More Compilation hints:

If you're using a distribution based on Redhat, Debian or Slackware,
you may want to download checkinstall before compiling and installing
all this stuff. It'll help you to perform a clean uninstall und
integrate the installations into your package-system.

Be sure to compile libsamplerate and libsndfile with:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

this will make sure that you won't run into compiliation problems later on.


Configure wxWindows like this:

   ./configure --enable-gtk2 --enable-unicode

this will make wxWindows use the new GTK2 Library for the User Interface

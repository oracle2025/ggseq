      <p>If you want to move your sample within the timeline drag it
with the left Mousebutton to the desired Position. If you want to
duplicate a sample, use your right mouse button to drag a copy of the

      <p>You can also select a couple of samples on the timeline, just
drag a so called "rubberframe" around the samples you want to select.
After that you can use the same Actions as described before to
minipulate the selected Samples.</p>

      <p>You may want to listen to a sample before you drag it to the
timeline. For this you can use the Miniplayer. Do a Doubleclick on a
File in the Filelist to play it in the Miniplayer. Alternatively you
may select a file using a single click, and then press the tiny play
button in the Miniplayer to listen to it.</p>
      <p>This will work with the samples in the timeline to,
doubleclick on a sample inside the timeline, und the Miniplayer will
play it as well.</p>

      <p>If you want to adjust the volume of a track, you may want to
use the little dial control at the left of each track. You can also use
the mute button right beside the volume dial in case you don't want to
listen to a certain track temporarily.</p>

      <p>You might have noticed that the screenshots in this tutorial
show different colours for some samples on the timeline. You can
customize these colours for your setup too, just go the to appriate
Dialog using the button thats highlighted in the screenshot on the
right.</p>
      <p>There you can select a folder and a custom Colour for this
folder. From now on all samples inside this folder will be displayed in
your specified colour.</p>

      <p>During your time with Gungirl Sequencer, I'm sure you've seen
that samples are aligned to certain positions within the timeline, to
match the positions of the numbers on the ruler. This behavior is
customizable too, just select the highlighted button in the Toolbar and
adjust the value in the following dialog to fit your needs.</p>

      <td valign="top"> "And how the hell do I find out the appropriate
Value for this Snap Stuff?" might've been your first question when
reading through the previous paragraph. No Problem, just click on the
tiny button on the right of the filelist to show a little window that
will display some additional information for the file that's being
played in the Miniplayer. If you look at the "Frames" Number, you
possible want to use this value as your custom Snap Value.</td>

      <p>You may want to listen to

Miniplayer. Do a Doubleclick on a File in the Filelist to play it in
the Miniplayer. Alternatively you may select a file using a single
click, and then press the tiny play button in the Miniplayer to listen
to it.</p>
      <p>This will work with the

      <p>During your time with
Gungirl Sequencer, I'm sure you've seen that samples are aligned to
certain positions within the timeline, to match the positions of the
numbers on the ruler. This behavior is customizable too, just select
the highlighted button in the Toolbar and adjust the value in the

      <p>"And how the hell do I
find out the appropriate Value for this Snap Stuff?" might've been your
first question when reading through the previous paragraph. No Problem,
just click on the tiny button on the right of the filelist to show a
little window that will display some additional information for the
file that's being played in the Miniplayer. If you look at the "Frames"
Number, you possible want to use this value as your custom Snap Value.</p>
